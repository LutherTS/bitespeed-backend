## Extra Credits

- I've used zod to validate the provided phone numbers and emails.
- Phone numbers are accepted through a regex only if they exclusively include numbers.
- A phone number that begins with a + for country codes is also accepted.
- Emails can be provided as empty and if they're not, they are validated with the validator library's isEmail function.

- If two different secondary contacts are found, one via the phone number, another one via the email, the most recent of their primary contacts is selected for the response.
- If two different contacts are found, one primary, one secondary, the secondary contact is reassigned from its prexisting primary to the primary that was found.
- If two contacts are found and both are primary contacts, not only does the newest primary contact become the a secondary contact to the oldest one, the secondary contacts of the newest primary are also reassigned as secondaries to the oldest primary.
